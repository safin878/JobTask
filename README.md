# Project Name : JobTask-Codexshaper

## Overview
This project is developed following modern web development standards to ensure a responsive, cross-browser compatible, and pixel-perfect implementation based on the provided Figma design.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: Ensures semantic, structured, and modern markup.
- **SCSS/SASS**: Used for maintainable and scalable styling.
- **Swiper.js**: Integrated for slider functionality.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: Used for animations and interactive elements.
- **JavaScript (Optional)**: Implemented only when necessary to enhance functionality.

## Development Guidelines
### HTML Structure
- Follow HTML5 best practices.
- All attributes and tags should be written in lowercase.
- Avoid using HTML tags as selectors; use class-based selectors instead.

### CSS & SCSS Styling
- Ensure pixel-perfect implementation matching the Figma design.
- Maintain a component/element-based design approach:
  - Example: `.content {}` instead of `.section .wrapper .content {}`.
- Use SCSS/SASS for better organization and maintainability.
 
### Animations & Interactions
- Use **GSAP** for smooth animations and interactive elements.
- Ensure animations enhance user experience without causing performance issues.

### Slider Functionality
- Use **Swiper.js** for any slider components.
- Ensure smooth and responsive slider behavior.
